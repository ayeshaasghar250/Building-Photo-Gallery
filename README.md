# üñºÔ∏è CSS Flexbox Photo Gallery

This is a responsive photo gallery project built using **HTML5** and **CSS3 Flexbox**.  
It was developed as part of the [freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/) and focuses on modern layout techniques without using any external frameworks or libraries.


## üìå Objective

The main goal of this project is to practice and demonstrate how CSS Flexbox can be used to build a **responsive image gallery**.  
Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system that allows us to control the alignment, spacing, and wrapping behavior of elements inside a container. This project puts those concepts into action by creating a layout that adjusts automatically for different screen sizes.


## üß± Project Structure

- The project contains a single HTML file and a linked CSS stylesheet.
- It uses **semantic HTML elements** like `<header>`, `<div>`, and `<img>` to maintain structure and accessibility.
- The gallery contains exactly **nine image elements** arranged using Flexbox inside a `.gallery` container.


## üí° Key Features

‚úÖ **Responsive Layout:**  
The images adjust to screen width and rearrange themselves accordingly on smaller devices such as tablets and phones.

‚úÖ **Semantic HTML:**  
Elements are structured using meaningful tags that improve readability and accessibility.

‚úÖ **Modern CSS (Flexbox):**  
The layout is handled using `display: flex`, allowing easy alignment and wrapping of images.

‚úÖ **Lightweight Code:**  
There are no frameworks (like Bootstrap) or JavaScript used ‚Äî just clean HTML and CSS.

## üñºÔ∏è Gallery Details

- The `.gallery` container is styled using Flexbox properties such as `flex-wrap`, `justify-content`, and `gap`.
- All nine `<img>` elements are uniform in size, using either placeholder images or real image URLs.
- On smaller screens, the gallery automatically stacks or reduces the number of images per row.


## üìÅ How to View the Project

To view this project on your local computer:

1. Make sure the following two files are in the same folder:
   - `index.html`
   - `styles.css`

2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari).

That‚Äôs it! The photo gallery should appear and adjust according to your screen size.


## üß† What I Learned

Through this project, I practiced:
- Structuring clean and semantic HTML documents.
- Using Flexbox to build layouts that are both flexible and responsive.
- Applying mobile-first design thinking.
- Writing CSS that separates presentation from structure.
